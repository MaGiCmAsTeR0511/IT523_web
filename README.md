# Webapplikation

This repository is for an University project of the Ferdinand Porsche FernFH. This is the webapplikation Site to insert courses. These courses and their details will be sent to Discord within an specific channel.


## requirements

* PHP-Version >=7.1 but  < 8
* If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix)   
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for Download repository 
* MySQL database was used (but it should also work on SQL and PorstgreSQL as well)


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer
You have to go in the directory where you have downloaded the repository. The following command has to be executed in a console (cmd) of your choice:
`composer install` or `composer update`. 

Now the necessary dependencies will be installed, so that the application will work properly.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.

### Mail

Edit the file `config/mailer.php` with real data, for  Example
```php
    return [
    'class' => 'yii\swiftmailer\Mailer',
    'useFileTransport' => false,
    'transport' => [
        'class' => 'Swift_SmtpTransport',
        'host' => 'smtp.yii2.application',
        'username' => 'yii2',
        'password' => '1234',
        'port' => '999',
        'encryption' => 'tls',
    ],
];
```

### Run Migrations
Migrations are the way to generate Tables in your database provided by Yii.

To do this you have to run a console in your root-directory of the application. Afterwards you have to use the following command: `yii migrate`  

You will be asked if yii should execute these migrations (accept with Yes).

Now Yii will try to create the tables and foreign key for this application.


### Now your application should be ready to run on your Webserver
